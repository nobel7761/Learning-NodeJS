of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor, and on the performance of the Underlyings. The economic terms of the Notes are based

on BAC&#8217;s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and

the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC&#8217;s affiliates enter into. BAC&#8217;s internal funding rate is typically

lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate,

as well as the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges described below (see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; beginning

on page PS-8), reduced the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the

public offering price you are paying to purchase the Notes is greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing

(as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) (&#8220;ADDTV&#8221;) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs,

FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company&#8217;s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches

any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine

the country in which the company&#8217;s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company&#8217;s

revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years

of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data,

FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company&#8217;s principal

executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation &#8220;BDI&#8221; country, in which case the company will be

assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,

Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey,

Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies

incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.</P>

trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in

May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing member&#8217;s

closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from

its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must

have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing

stock does not trade on the &#8220;rank day&#8221; (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is announced each

stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any

other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants

and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist,

they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (<I>e.g</I>., tracking stocks), each

class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class

with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.</P>

year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution

of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior

Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking

within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a

security&#8217;s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as &#8220;free float.&#8221;

is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total

shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For

example, if a company&#8217;s officers and directors hold 3% of the company&#8217;s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the

company&#8217;s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company&#8217;s

officers and directors hold 3% of the company&#8217;s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company&#8217;s shares, SPDJI

would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company&#8217;s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control.

As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX

prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent

company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the

S&amp;P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate

methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941

through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and

track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been

set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is

computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the &#8220;index divisor.&#8221; By itself, the index divisor is

an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the

SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index

maintenance.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">Index maintenance includes monitoring and completing

the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to

company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares

outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to

corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting

the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of

individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing

level.</P>

possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented when

the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change. All

other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options,

warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations)

are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than

5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to

provided in this pricing supplement is derived from Dow Jones Indexes, the marketing name and a licensed trademark of SPDJI. The INDU

is a price-weighted index, which means an underlying stock&#8217;s weight in the INDU is based on its price per share rather than the

total market capitalization of the issuer. The INDU is designed to provide an indication of the composite performance of 30 common stocks

of corporations representing a broad cross-section of U.S. industry. The corporations represented in the INDU tend to be market leaders

in their respective industries and their stocks are typically widely held by individuals and institutional investors.</P>

of three representatives of SPDJI and two representatives of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> (&#8220;WSJ&#8221;). Generally, composition

changes occur only after mergers, corporate acquisitions or other dramatic shifts in a component's core business. When such an event necessitates

that one component be replaced, the entire INDU is reviewed. As a result, when changes are made they typically involve more than one component.

While there are no rules for component selection, a stock typically is added only if it has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained

growth, is of interest to a large number of investors and accurately represents the sector(s) covered by the average.</P>

on an as-needed basis. Changes to the common stocks included in the INDU tend to be made infrequently, and the underlying stocks of the

INDU may be changed at any time for any reason. The companies currently represented in the INDU are incorporated in the United States

Basic Materials; Consumer Goods; Consumer Services; Financials; Healthcare; Industrials; Oil &amp; Gas; Technology; and Telecommunications.</P>

in the level of the INDU. Because the INDU is price-weighted, stock splits or changes in the component stocks could result in distortions

in the INDU level. In order to prevent these distortions related to extrinsic factors, the divisor is periodically changed in accordance

with a mathematical formula that reflects adjusted proportions within the INDU. The current divisor of the INDU is published daily in

the WSJ and other publications. In addition, other statistics based on the INDU may be found in a variety of publicly available sources.</P>

BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase or repurchase the Notes

at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all of

their selling concessions, fees or commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these fee-based advisory

accounts may be as low as $967.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The Notes are our debt securities, the return on which

is linked to the performance of the Underlyings. The related guarantee is BAC&#8217;s obligation. As is the case for all of our and BAC&#8217;s

respective debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC&#8217;s actual or perceived

creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes result in increased operational, funding and liability

management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer to in this pricing

supplement as BAC&#8217;s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for a conventional fixed

or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the economic terms of the

Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, resulted in the initial estimated value of the Notes on the

pricing date being less than their public offering price.</P>

at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options

or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms

provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC&#8217;s creditworthiness, interest

rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes

and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.</P>

include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates&#8217; profit earned from, these hedging arrangements.

Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging transactions

of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the Notes, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors

regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the Notes. In particular, the IRS could seek to subject the Notes

to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character

of income on the Notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required to accrue original issue discount

every year at a &#8220;comparable yield&#8221; determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s

prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter.</P>

which sought comments from the public on the taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as &#8220;prepaid forward contracts.&#8221;

This Notice addresses instruments such as the Notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of

an instrument such as the Notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis, regardless of whether any payments are

made prior to maturity. It is not possible to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future

guidance may affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The IRS and Treasury are also considering additional

issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether foreign holders

of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain

&#8220;constructive ownership transactions,&#8221; generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of

these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">In addition, proposed Treasury regulations require the

accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the regulations

states that the &#8220;wait and see&#8221; method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on those contracts,

and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence. While the proposed regulations do not apply to prepaid

forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the case of prepaid

forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent payments on prepaid

forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the Notes.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">Because of the absence of authority regarding the appropriate

tax characterization of the Notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the Notes in a manner that results in tax

consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or loss that a holder

may recognize at maturity or upon the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes should be treated as ordinary gain or loss.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">Because each Underlying is an index that periodically

rebalances, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a series of single financial contracts, each of which matures on the next

rebalancing date. If the Notes were properly characterized in such a manner, a U.S. Holder would be treated as disposing of the Notes

on each rebalancing date in return for new Notes that mature on the next rebalancing date, and a U.S. Holder would accordingly likely

recognize capital gain or loss on each rebalancing date equal to the difference between the holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Notes (which

would be adjusted to take into account any prior recognition of gain or loss) and the fair market value of the Notes on such date.</P>

Holder of a U.S. trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their settlement

to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding

tax, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder.

Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading &#8220;&#8212;U.S. Holders,&#8221; for a description of the U.S. federal

income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation,

it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of

its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">A &#8220;dividend equivalent&#8221; payment is treated

as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid

to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (&#8220;ELIs&#8221;)

that are &#8220;specified ELIs&#8221; may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an &#8220;underlying

security,&#8221; which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment

with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, IRS guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent

payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1, 2023. Based on our

determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments, Non-U.S. Holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent

payments, if any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income

tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Underlyings or the Notes, and following such occurrence the Notes could

be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. Holders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions

in respect of the Underlyings or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding

tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding,

we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect

to amounts so withheld.</P>

of the law, by regulation or otherwise, cause payments as to the Notes to become subject to withholding tax, tax will be withheld at the
